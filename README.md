# Now. (WWDC2023)
## _Your safe space_

Even in the midst of chaos, we can maintain our mental and emotional health by practicing inner serenity and tranquility. Take a deep breath, find a quiet location, and keep in mind that you have the capacity to choose how you respond to the world around you if you're feeling overburdened by the busyness of modern life.

**Now.** is a safe space where you may pause, unwind, and contemplate about the *present*. It sticks to the principles of *Stoic* philosophy. 
This experience is designed so that it can be tried several times, even as a daily exercise.

Even in the middle of the chaos of daily life, it offers a secure space to contemplate and refuel thanks to its stoic inspiration.

>‚Äú One of the best pieces of advice I ever got was from a horse master. He told me to go slow to go fast. I think that applies to everything in life. We live as though there aren't enough hours in the day but if we do each thing calmly and carefully we will get it done quicker and with much less stress.. ‚Äù 
> Viggo Mortensen

## How I built it

I wanted to create an experience that was relaxing and pleasing to the eye. I set out to create simple but pleasing illustrations, following an artistic direction. All illlustrations were created by me. The font I used is called 'Gentium Plus'. This experience is built entirely using the **SwiftUI** framework to build the interface. For the sounds and background music, I used the **AVFoundation** framework. The app uses also **CoreData** for the persistence of the data. The whole project was built using the latest design patterns (**MVVM**) and good code pratices. Finally, I tried to make the app accessible by using **accessibilityLabels**.

## Assets

The drawings were created by me using ProCreate.
The sounds were created by me using GarageBand.
